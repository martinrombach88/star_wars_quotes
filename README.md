# star_wars_quotes
A Star Wars quote generator

Concept:
A website that generates a Star Wars quote, and changes automatically depending on the 'side' of the character. So if the quote is from a light side character, for example 'Luke Skywalker', the styling and background changes to  the light side background (a hangar with a space ship) and css styling for the central quote. If the quote is from a dark side character, for example 'Darth Vader', the background changes to a dark side background (dark spaceship deck), and the styling changes too.

Current plan:
1. Create templates of both the light side and dark side pages. (Complete)
2. Test and integrate the Star Wars quotes API functionality into one of the pages. (Complete)
3. Implement a button for requesting new quotes from the API on user click.
4. Implement a button for sending Star Wars quotes to Twitter.
5. Build one of the template pages into the DOM, triggering the HTML when a dark side quote is present. Contain all content in 1 page. (Complete)
6. Implement a smooth transition between quotes on reload.
