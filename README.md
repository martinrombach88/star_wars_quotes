# star_wars_quotes
A Star Wars quote generator

Concept:
A website that generates a Star Wars quote, and changes automatically depending on the 'side' of the character. So if the quote is from a light side character, for example 'Luke Skywalker', the styling and background changes to  the light side background (a hangar with a space ship) and css styling for the central quote. If the quote is from a dark side character, for example 'Darth Vader', the background changes to a dark side background (dark spaceship deck), and the styling changes too.

Update: The original API has proven inconsistent with responsiveness, so I've chosen to make my own
JSON file that include 30 Star Wars quotes as a sample. I've included the original API commented in the code,
so it can be tested if anyone is interested in the original functionality.

I had thought about creating my own API to replace the original, but I have more pressing responsibilities
and need to finish the project.
